# IDD — Design Rationale and Maintainer Notes

This document collects maintainer-facing rationale, diagnostics, and
narrative justifications that explain _why_ IDD phase rules exist as
they do. The rules themselves stay in
`.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`; this file is the place to
record the context that helps future maintainers evaluate edits to
those rules without bloating the auto-loaded instruction surface.

Each section corresponds to one phase file. Add new rationale entries
under the matching phase heading. Behavior-changing constraints
(fail-closed defaults, claim revalidation, marker authority) must
remain in the instruction files.

### A3 — Diagnostic: all candidates blocked by an open roadmap

When the A3 decision tree reports zero ready-to-start candidates and
every candidate is blocked by an
`<!-- idd-skill-blocked-by: X -->` marker that points to an open
roadmap, the markers may be misused as grouping tags. Sub-tasks that
run while the roadmap is open belong in the task list
(`- [ ] #NNN`); the `blocked-by` marker is reserved for issues that
must wait for a separate roadmap to close first. Treat this pattern
as a likely authoring defect, not a real dependency stall.

### A4 Step 1.5 — Rationale: active-claim pre-scan

Active-claim pre-scans eliminate known collisions deterministically
and reduce wasted claim-post-recheck cycles, improving scale-out
efficiency when multiple sessions start simultaneously. Without the
pre-scan, parallel sessions all claim the lowest-numbered viable
candidate at the same second, then race the same-second tie-break;
the pre-scan moves the resolution earlier in the pipeline so most
sessions never touch the same issue.
