# IDD — Design Rationale and Maintainer Notes

This document collects maintainer-facing rationale, diagnostics, and
narrative justifications that explain _why_ IDD phase rules exist as
they do. The rules themselves stay in
`.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`; this file is the place to
record the context that helps future maintainers evaluate edits to
those rules without bloating the auto-loaded instruction surface.

Each section corresponds to one phase file. Add new rationale entries
under the matching phase heading. Behavior-changing constraints
(fail-closed defaults, claim revalidation, marker authority) must
remain in the instruction files.

## Discover

### A0-O roadmap-first fallback triggers

The `roadmap-first` A0-O fallback originally fired only when **zero
candidates reached A3.5** (trigger (a)) — A2 found no open execution
leaves, or A3 filtered them all out as blocked. But a candidate can reach
A3.5 and still be unworkable: the workshop leaves #553 (which runs a real
external deployment) and #611 (a "published" convergence checkpoint)
pass A3 readiness and A3.5 (the owner self-approves), then fail the A4
viability gate (Autonomous completion). Because they reached A3.5, the
original trigger stayed suppressed, so A4 stopped with "no viable
issue" and never fell back to A0-O even when claimable orphan issues
existed — forcing an operator opt-in every loop. The same shadowing
occurred when A4 Step 1.5 eliminated the last A3.5-startable candidate.

Trigger (b) closes that gap: the fallback also fires when the roadmap
path yields no viable, startable, unclaimed candidate because A4
Step 1 viability discards them all or Step 1.5 eliminates the last.
Three guards keep it safe:

- **Approval hold precedence.** A non-empty A3.5 approval-needed
  bucket is not a true zero; the fallback fires on viability/claim
  exhaustion only, never on the approval hold, so it never re-scopes
  around the approval gate.
- **True zero only.** It fires only when no viable, startable,
  unclaimed roadmap candidate remains — never when A4 discards some
  candidates but keeps others.
- **At most once per pass.** A0-O runs at most once as the
  roadmap-first fallback per Discover pass. Once spent (via trigger
  (a) or (b)), a later A4 Step 1 / Step 1.5 exhaustion reports and
  stops (not an abort) without re-entering A0-O; A0-O's own
  zero-orphan result separately routes to the A3 decision tree. This
  prevents an A1 ↔ A0-O or A4 ↔ A0-O loop.

When both the roadmap path (whether it returned zero A3.5-reaching
candidates or exhausted at A4 viability / active-claim) and the orphan
fallback yield nothing, discovery lands in the A3 decision tree,
exactly as the zero-reach-A3.5 case did before.

The `orphan-first` symmetric case — orphan candidates all failing A4,
which would fall back to the roadmap path — is a separate concern and
out of scope here.

### A3 — Diagnostic: all candidates blocked by an open roadmap

When the A3 decision tree reports zero ready-to-start candidates and
every candidate is blocked by an
`<!-- idd-skill-blocked-by: X -->` marker that points to an open
roadmap, the markers may be misused as grouping tags. Sub-tasks that
run while the roadmap is open belong in the task list
(`- [ ] #NNN`); the `blocked-by` marker is reserved for issues that
must wait for a separate roadmap to close first. Treat this pattern
as a likely authoring defect, not a real dependency stall.

### A4 Step 1.5 — Rationale: active-claim pre-scan

Active-claim pre-scans eliminate known collisions deterministically
and reduce wasted claim-post-recheck cycles, improving scale-out
efficiency when multiple sessions start simultaneously. Without the
pre-scan, parallel sessions all claim the lowest-numbered viable
candidate at the same second, then race the same-second tie-break;
the pre-scan moves the resolution earlier in the pipeline so most
sessions never touch the same issue.

### A4 Step 2 — Rationale: concurrent-selection desync

A4 Step 1.5 (active-claim pre-scan) and A5(e) (collision detection plus
same-second tie-break) only resolve a selection collision **reactively**:
a losing session has already posted its claim and snapshot, then re-enters
Discover and — because Step 2's tie-break is the fully deterministic
lowest-issue-number — **re-collides** on the next candidate. Observed in a
multi-session run as a 3-way race on one score-5 issue whose two losers
then re-collided on the next lowest number.

The opt-in `discover.selectionDesync: session-offset` knob adds a
**proactive** desync: within a single highest-score tie band it picks the
entry at `selectDesyncedIndex(session-token, band-size)` (a pure
`hash(session-token) mod band-size`, the token being the selection-time
`{agent-id}`) instead of always index 0, spreading concurrent sessions
across _different_ eligible issues up front.

It is off by default and reorders **only within** a same-score tie band so
the documented score-then-lowest-number ranking is the unchanged single-
session and fallback behavior. The load-bearing invariant is that the
branch name (`issue/<n>-<slug>`) derives from the issue, not selection
order, so spreading sessions across different issues never breaks the
same-issue branch convergence that A5(e) and the `branch-name` helper rely
on. The desync never crosses score bands and never bypasses the A4.5/A5
gates; the in-band offset function is replaceable without affecting these
invariants.

## Claim resolution

### Forced-handoff strictness: strict resume vs. lenient relay-merge

Both the resume-routing read (`evaluateResumeClaimRouting` in
`resume-claim-routing.mts`) and the pre-merge write-gate
(`summarizeClaimValidation` in `protocol-helpers.mts`) resolve the active claim
through the **single** shared `resolveActiveClaim`, so there is no forked
claim-state logic. They deliberately pass **different** forced-handoff options,
and that difference is intentional policy, not drift:

- **Resume routing is strict.** It sets `requireAuthorMatchesForcedBy: true`
  (rule 7's author/`forcedBy` binding) and never passes `prFirstCommitAt`.
  Resume is a _takeover_ decision, so it must block the same-identity
  self-signed hijack and reject an issue-only handoff that targets a PR-backed
  claim.
- **The merge write-gate is lenient.** It leaves `requireAuthorMatchesForcedBy`
  at its off default and passes `prFirstCommitAt`, applying the Part-B allowance
  (kurone-kito/idd-skill#1058, an issue-only handoff predating the PR). The
  merge gate re-validates an _already-verified_ session and must tolerate a
  maintainer-authorized handoff relayed by a separate automation actor;
  authorization then rests on `isAuthorizedForcedHandoff` alone.

Because the two callers apply different strictness, they can return **different
verdicts for the same corrected-handoff state** — resume may report
`already_owned` while the merge gate reports `claimLost`. This is expected: the
verdicts answer different questions (may I take over? vs. does this verified
session still own the write?).

The split is kept intentionally (see kurone-kito/idd-skill#1155): the structural
risk the adopter raised — two divergent resolvers — is already removed by the
shared `resolveActiveClaim`, and forcing both sides strict would break the
legitimate relay use-case. Any future change here must preserve the single
resolver (do not fork `resolveActiveClaim`) and the resume-side
self-signed-hijack block.
